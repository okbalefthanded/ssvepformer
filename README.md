# SSVEPformer
A transformer-based model for SSVEP classifcation in EEG based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)

Reproducing the paper [A transformer-based deep neural network model for SSVEP classification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608023002319) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04172) [1] on Dataset 1 from Nakanishi et al.2015 [2]

We followed the same procedure in the paper in the 1st experiment on the same dataset and got same results. to reproduce the experiment check the colab notebook in this repo, it is a straighforward self contained tutorial.

# Requirements
 - PyTorch 
 - Numpy
 - Scipy
